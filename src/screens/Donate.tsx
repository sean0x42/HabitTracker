          . I'm a software developer and designer in Australia. I made this app
          with a simple aim: to help build and maintain habits in my personal
          life.

          This app is not trying to be "the next big thing". It's humble,
          reliable, and does exactly what it says on the tin. It contains ZERO
          advertisements, and no paid plans to lock features behind a pay wall.
